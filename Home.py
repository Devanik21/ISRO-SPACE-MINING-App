    ### âœ¨ The Recommendation Model
    - The recommendation model evaluates space mining sites 
    based on user-defined feature weights and a trained 
    machine learning model.
    - It normalizes input data, predicts suitability scores, and adjusts for user preferences.
    - Finally, it ranks sites to provide the top recommendations.
    - Users interactively adjust feature weight/priority and the model recommends best minesites available.
